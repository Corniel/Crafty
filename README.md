# Crafty
Crafty is the "son" (direct descendent) of the chess program Cray Blitz.  it is designed totally around the bit-board data structure for reasons of speed of execution, ease of adding new knowledge, and a significantly cleaner overall design.  it is written totally in ANSI C with some few UNIX system calls required for I/O, etc.                                               *
